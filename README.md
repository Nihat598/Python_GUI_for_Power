# Python_GUI_for_Power
I did this project for a very well known company in Turkey, Arcelik. I designed a GUI in Python using Tkinter and CustomTkinter libraries for power calculation of different electronics components. This is very useful in the calculation of Junction Temperatures of integrated chips, whose formula depends on the power value.
