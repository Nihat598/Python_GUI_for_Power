# Python_GUI_for_Power
I did this project for a very well known company in Turkey, Arcelik. I designed a GUI in Python using Tkinter and CustomTkinter libraries for the power calculation of different electronic components. This is very useful in the calculation of Junction Temperatures of integrated chips, whose formula depends on the power value. After the user is done with the calculations and closes the interface window, the results are exported to an Excel file in the same directory automatically
